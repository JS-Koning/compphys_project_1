# Weekly progress journal
[[_TOC_]]
## Instructions

In this journal you will document your progress of the project, making use of the weekly milestones.

Every week you should 

1. write down **on the day of the lecture** a short plan (bullet list is sufficient) of how you want to 
   reach the weekly milestones. Think about how to distribute work in the group, 
   what pieces of code functionality need to be implemented.
2. write about your progress **until Sunday, 23:59** before the next lecture with respect to the milestones.
   Substantiate your progress with links to code, pictures or test results. Reflect on the
   relation to your original plan.

We will give feedback on your progress on Tuesday before the following lecture. Consult the 
[grading scheme](https://computationalphysics.quantumtinkerer.tudelft.nl/proj1-moldyn-grading/) 
for details how the journal enters your grade.

Note that the file format of the journal is *markdown*. This is a flexible and easy method of 
converting text to HTML. 
Documentation of the syntax of markdown can be found 
[here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#gfm-extends-standard-markdown). 
You will find how to include [links](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#links) and 
[images](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#images) particularly
useful.

## Week 1
1. General
    - Get used to gitlab, make first commits and verify that these work.
    - Discuss working method, match schedules to work together.
    
2. Objectives
    - [ ] Calculate the force on each particle using the Lennard-Jones potential
    - [ ] Implement the Euler method for time evolution
    - [ ] Implement the periodic boundary condition
    - [ ] Define a function that calculates the total energy of the system
    - [ ] Make sure that you commit your code regularly to Gitlab.
