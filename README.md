# Project 1: Molecular dynamics simulation of Argon atoms
last updated: 27/02/2021
<br>

This is the first project for Computational Physics (AP3082) year 2020/2021, T-course of the master Applied Physics at the Delft University of Technology.
The code is written for Python 3.8.6 using JupyterLab v2.2.9 web-based userinterface. 
<br>

This program plots the relative distance, force and energy of 2 and 32 argon particles with 3 dimensions.
The potential of the argon atoms is based on the Lennard-Jones potential and thus, so is the force. 
Simulation should take a maximum of 15 minutes.
<hr>
To run the program:
Import all files in the directory and run main.py
<br>
optional:<br>
-edit parameters<br>
allowed parameters with full functionality:<br>
-    sim.verlet<br>
-    sim.box_dim <br>
-    sim.num_atoms<br>
-    sim.rescaling<br>
-    sim.temp <br>
<br>
run main.py (for supported versions of Python please see <strong>Installation</strong>)

## functionality


   - Non-dimensional SI units
       - All inputs and outputs are non-dimensional
   - Periodic or non-periodic boundary conditions
   - Initial random locations
       - Only inside predefined box size
   - Initial 'random' velocities 
       - Based, but not exact, on 3D equipartiton theorem, changing dimensions in parameters does not change random velocity algorithm
   - Plots of total energy
   - Plots of kinetic energy
   - Plots of potential energy
   - Choice of Euler method numerical approximation or Verlet algorithm
   - Potential (and thus force) based on Lennard-Jones potential
   - Rescaling of velocities based on target temperature
   
   
   
## Installation
Usage of JupyterLab v2.2.9 is recommended, different versions might have reduced functionability/performance. For an installation manual please visit the [Jupyterlab documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).
Since this code is written using Python 3.8.6, it is likely that most features will work for various IDE's running Python 3.8.6.
