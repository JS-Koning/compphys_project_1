# Project 1: Molecular dynamics simulation of Argon atoms

This is the first project for Computational Physics (AP3082) year 2020/2021, T-course of the master Applied Physics at the Delft University of Technology.
The code is written for Python 3.8.6 using JupyterLab v2.2.9 web-based userinterface. 


## Description
Currently, due to the lack of functionality no description is available.

## Installation
Usage of JupyterLab v2.2.9 is recommended, different versions might have reduced functionability/performance. For an installation manual please visit [https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).
Since this code is written using Python 3.8.6, it is likely that most features will work for various IDE's running Python 3.8.6.
