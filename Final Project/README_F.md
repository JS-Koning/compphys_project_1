# Project 1: Molecular dynamics simulation of Argon atoms
last updated: 27/02/2021
<br>

This is the first project for Computational Physics (AP3082) year 2020/2021, T-course of the master Applied Physics at the Delft University of Technology.
The code is written for Python 3.8.6 using JupyterLab v2.2.9 web-based userinterface. 
<br>

This program plots the relative distance, force and energy of N argon particles with a maximum 3 dimensions.
The potential of the argon atoms is based on the Lennard-Jones potential and thus, so is the force.

To run the program: <br>
optional: edit parameters <br>
run skeleton.py (for supported versions of Python please see <strong>Installation</strong>

## functionality


   - Dimensional, and non-dimensional SI units
       - Currently, all inputs and outputs are in either dimensional or non-dimensional form, no combination is supported
   - Periodic or non-periodic boundary conditions
   - Initial random locations
       - Only inside predefined box size
   - Initial 'random' velocities 
       - loosely based on 3D equipartiton theorem, changing dimensions in parameters does not change random velocity algorithm
   - Plots of total distance between atoms
   - Plots of total energy
   - Plots of kinetic energy
   - Plots of potential energy
   - Choice of Euler method numerical approximation or Verlet algorithm
   - Potential (and thus force) based on Lennard-Jones potential


## Installation
Usage of JupyterLab v2.2.9 is recommended, different versions might have reduced functionability/performance. For an installation manual please visit the [Jupyterlab documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).
Since this code is written using Python 3.8.6, it is likely that most features will work for various IDE's running Python 3.8.6.
